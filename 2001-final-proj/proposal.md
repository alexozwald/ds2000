*BMRG: biocide/metal resistance genes*

*ARG: antibiotic resistance genes*

BMRG and ARG can co-occurrence which make it more challenging to kill the bacteria. Currently, the data presenting which biocides and metals that are likely to co-select for resistance towards certain classes of antibiotics is limited. 

If resistance genes for both antibiotics and biocides/metals are physically located** on the same plasmid,** metal/biocide exposure can also** promote horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance. **Today, conjugative plasmids carrying ARGs have become a major health challenge in clinical settings. In addition, environmental microbial communities maintain diverse collections of resistance genes which might be mobilized into pathogenic bacteria via HGT. Therefore, understanding the **associations between plasmid mobility and their potential for co-selection** on a larger scale would be valuable to improve our ability to identify risk scenarios.

Aim of the project: identify which BMRG and ARG in plasmid tend to occur together. In other words, a gene located in plasmid that shares resistance to both biocides/metals and antibiotics.
