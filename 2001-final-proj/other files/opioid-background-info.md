The origin: 

In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers, and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. This subsequently led to widespread diversion and misuse of these medications before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.

Overdose waves: 

Nearly 500,000 people died from overdoses involving any opioid, including prescription and illicit opioids, from 1999-2019.1

This rise in opioid overdose deaths can be outlined in three distinct waves.

1.  The first wave began with increased prescribing of opioids in the 1990s, with overdose deaths involving [prescription opioids](https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/prescribed.html) (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) increasing since at least 1999.2

2.  The second wave began in 2010, with rapid increases in overdose deaths involving [heroin](https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/heroin.html).3

3.  The third wave began in 2013, with significant increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, particularly those involving illicitly manufactured [fentanyl](https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/fentanyl.html).4,5,6 The market for illicitly manufactured fentanyl continues to change, and it can be found in combination with heroin, counterfeit pills, and cocaine.
